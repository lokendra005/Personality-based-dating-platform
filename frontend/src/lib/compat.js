// The score is a mean of (1 - |difference|) across the Big Five traits both
// people have answered. It is one number derived from five self-reported
// values, so it does not resolve to a percentage point — everything here
// coarsens deliberately.

// The server returns a literal 0.5 when two people share no answered traits
// (backend/internal/handlers/match.go). A real mean can land on 0.5 too, but
// treating the sentinel as unscored fails safe: better to under-claim than to
// present a confident number computed from nothing.
